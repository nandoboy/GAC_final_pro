#Handling training data
#read features data set(source : 'X_train.txt'),activity IDs and subject IDs into separate data frames
#merge the 3 frames into 1 frame for traiing data using 'cbind'

#Handling test data
#read features data set(source : 'X_test.txt'),activity IDs and subject IDs into separate data frames
#merge the 3 frames into 1 frame for traiing data using 'cbind'

#merge training and test frames to form complete master frame using 'rbind'

#name master frame columns using feature names from file :'features.txt'
#extract columns having mean or standard deviation value from master frame using 'grep'

#calculate mean of each column grouped by activity and subject_ID using dplyr
#write table thus obtained to file 'tidy_set.txt'


#below is list of variables,description as to how they were obtained(tab delimited)
